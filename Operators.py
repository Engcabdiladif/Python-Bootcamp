# operators        
# this language have like *,+,\, this calle arimetic
# modulus or remenders  %
#
# x= 5
# y= 2
# print(x % y)

# Exponentiation  jibaarid weye  **

# x = 5
# y = 3
# print(x ** y)

# floor  wuun hadhaag ka saaraya meehs as int uu isku soo qaoraya

# x = 15
# y = 2
# print(x // 2)

# comparison   is barbar dhig

#  is equl to : ==
# isn equl to: !=
# great then: >
# less then: <
# gret or equl: >=
# less or erual: <=
                       # Example

# x = 10
# y = 9
# print( x==y)  # is false
#
#                                   this is comparsison
# T = 34
# z = 35
# print( T <= z) # is True
#
# p = 56
# u = 76
# print(p >= u) # is false


      # Logical operator

# and ,or ,not   kuligood ture iyo false soo sarayan

# y = 5
# x = 5
# t = 10
# j = 18
# #
# #
# if not(y ==x and t == j):
#     print('they are all same ')
# else:
#     print('not all same')

  # identity operators  is , is not   ture or false

# x =  5
# y = 5
# print(x is y)
                         # this called identity operators
# m =10
# k = 12
# print(m is not k )
